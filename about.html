<p>

Theo has been designing websites for several years with experience in WordPress, HTML, CSS and Javascript. The latter three allow him to deliver a faster and more customisable website, unlike other web design agencies who only use WordPress.

Speed is incredibly important to Google and other search engines. It's also important to users, 40% abandon websites that take more than 3 seconds to load (KissMetrics). Our latest website (Marlborough Structural Design) has a load time of 0.7 seconds see more, that's over seven times faster than the average page speed allowing them to achieve near top rankings.
<br><br>
Our websites also rank strongly in Google's Lighthouse test, with the same site we achieve an outstanding score of 99% (see more). If you google  'Structural Engineer Marlborough' (do it), the first two results are big companies, closely followed by our client's website.
