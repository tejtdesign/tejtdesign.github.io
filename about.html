Theo has been designing websites for several years with experience in WordPress, HTML, CSS and Javascript. The latter three allow him to deliver a faster and more customisable website, unlike other web design agencies who only use WordPress.

Speed is incredibly important to Google and other search engines. It's also important to users, 40% abandon websites that take more than 3 seconds to load (KissMetrics). Our latest website (Marlborough Structural Design) has a load time of 0.7 seconds <a href="https://gtmetrix.com/reports/marlboroughstructuraldesign.co.uk/Q15f5S9B">(see more)<a>, that's over seven times faster than the average page speed allowing them to achieve near top rankings.
<br><br>
Our websites also rank strongly in Google's Lighthouse test, with the same site we achieve an outstanding score of 99% (<a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmarlboroughstructuraldesign.co.uk%2F&tab=desktop">see more</a>). If you google  'Structural Engineer Marlborough' (<a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=Structural+Engineer+Marlborough&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8">do it</a>), the first two results are big companies, closely followed by our client's website.
